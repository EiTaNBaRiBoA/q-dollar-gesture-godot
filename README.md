A very simple $Q Gesture Recognizer implementation in Godot. Not fit for an add-on as it is currently.

## How to add new gesture templates
1. Open the gesture_node scene or just click on the GestureNode within the test_scene scene.
2. Check "Create New Gesture" on the GestureNode
3. Fill out the Gesture Name and Gesture File Name slots
4. When filling out the file name but adding templates for the same gesture name, make sure to manually change the file name as to avoid overwriting the other templates
5. Launch the scene
6. Draw the new gesture template shape and right click
7. Upon exiting the scene, your new gesture template should be added to the gesture_templates folder!
